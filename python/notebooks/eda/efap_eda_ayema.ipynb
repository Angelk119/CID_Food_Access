    "# CONTEXT - Program-Level EFAP Structure and Access Model\n",
    "The EFAP dataset represents the supply-side structure of New York City’s emergency food assistance system. At the program level, each site is categorized by its access type, primarily distinguishing between pantry access (take-home groceries) and kitchen access (prepared hot meals). Pantry programs provide groceries such as canned goods, rice, pasta, or produce, which households are expected to store and prepare themselves. Kitchen programs, in contrast, provide prepared meals on-site, typically consumed the same day. Some programs may offer both, but the distinction between pantry and kitchen access reflects fundamentally different models of food support.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the EFAP system is predominantly pantry-based, this suggests that the city’s emergency food infrastructure is structured around assumptions of household stability and food preparation capacity. Pantry programs implicitly assume that recipients have access to refrigeration, food storage, cooking appliances, and predictable routines for meal preparation. In contrast, kitchen-based programs provide immediate, ready-to-eat meals and require fewer household-level resources, making them more accessible for individuals or families without consistent cooking facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is especially important in the context of families living in shelters. Shelter conditions vary by facility type. Some family shelters, including commercial hotel placements, may offer limited or no in-room kitchen access, shared facilities with restricted hours, or minimal storage capacity. In such contexts, a pantry-dominant food assistance system may not align with the lived realities of shelter residents. While pantry programs increase food availability, they may not translate into functional access if families lack the means to safely store or prepare groceries. Kitchen-based programs may better support immediate food needs for families with constrained living arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, analyzing the distribution of pantry versus kitchen access within EFAP is not merely descriptive. It provides insight into the underlying design of the city’s food assistance system and allows us to evaluate whether the structure of supply aligns with the housing instability and facility constraints experienced by families in shelters. This structural lens strengthens our later neighborhood-level analysis by clarifying what “food access” functionally means before examining where programs are geographically located."

    "- While access_type provides categorical information about the service model, separate binary indicators (has_pantry_access, has_kitchen_access) were engineered to allow clearer analytical and modeling flexibility. These flags preserve overlap for hybrid sites and enable direct measurement of pantry and kitchen capacity without requiring categorical encoding. This structure simplifies aggregation and supports later neighborhood-level modeling of supply composition."

    "- The distribution of access types shows that approximately 80% of EFAP programs are pantry-only, 15% are kitchen-only, and 5% provide both pantry and kitchen access. When examining access flags more broadly, 85% of programs offer pantry access (including hybrid sites), while only about 20% offer kitchen access. This indicates that NYC’s EFAP system is heavily structured around a take-home grocery model rather than prepared meal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Side note: The predominance of pantry-based EFAP programs suggests a supply model centered on take-home food preparation, which may not fully align with the constraints faced by families in shelter settings with limited cooking and storage access.\n",
    "    - This makes me ask why do they priotrize pantries? However that's scope creeping because our CRQ is not \"Why is the system pantry dominant?” but \"Do high-priority neighborhoods have fewer food assistance options?\"! "
