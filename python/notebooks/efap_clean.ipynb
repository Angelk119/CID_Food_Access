    "## Key assumption\n",
    "We assume that the EFAP food assistance site landscape remained largely stable between 2023 and 2024, and therefore use the November 4, 2024 EFAP dataset as a proxy for food assistance site availability across both years of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## key limitation\n",
    "Because EFAP data are only available as point-in-time snapshots, this approach does not capture potential changes in site availability between 2023 and 2024, such as temporary closures, relocations, or newly established programs. As a result, supply measures may not reflect short-term fluctuations in food assistance access over time."

    "The EFAP dataset classifies food assistance sites using several administrative program type codes (e.g., FP, SK, FPK, FPH). While these codes capture operational differences across programs, they are not directly interpretable as meaningful differences in food access at the neighborhood level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To align program classifications with how residents experience food assistance, we mapped EFAP program types into two access indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pantry access: whether a site provides take-home groceries\n",
    "\n",
    "Kitchen access: whether a site provides prepared meals on site\n",
    "\n",
    "Program types beginning with FP were classified as providing pantry access, program types beginning with SK were classified as providing kitchen access, and FPK sites were classified as providing both forms of access. This approach preserves the original program type codes while enabling consistent aggregation of food access options across neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than splitting EFAP sites into multiple fine-grained categories, we focus on pantry and kitchen access as baseline measures of food availability. Although operational details such as hours and distribution models meaningfully shape access, inconsistencies in schedule reporting limit our ability to model these factors reliably. As a result, our analysis captures the presence of food assistance services while acknowledging that timing and usability may further constrain access.\n",
    "\n",
    "This standardization supports neighborhood-level comparisons of food access without over-interpreting administrative subtypes that do not reflect substantively different access experiences."

For every record, the function sends the house number, street name, and borough to Geoclient and attempts to retrieve the corresponding Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) along with latitude and longitude coordinates. If the API request fails or does not return a valid address response, the function safely returns null values rather than dropping the record. The resulting NTA identifier and coordinates are then added as new columns to the dataset, preserving all original rows while enriching the data with geographic context needed for neighborhood-level analysis.

    "For the EFAP dataset, the goal of this step was to assign each food assistance site to a Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) and obtain geographic coordinates so the data could be analyzed at the neighborhood level. The raw EFAP data includes street address, borough, and ZIP code information, but it does not include latitude, longitude, or NTA identifiers. Because the project’s analysis is conducted at the neighborhood level, geocoding was required to translate site addresses into official NYC geographic units.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, NYC Geoclient was used as the geocoding service. Geoclient was chosen over general-purpose geocoders because it is maintained by the City of New York and returns authoritative NYC-specific geography, including NTA codes. This ensures higher accuracy and consistency when mapping EFAP sites to neighborhoods. A Geoclient API key was created through the NYC API Portal and stored securely as an environment variable so that credentials were not exposed in the notebook or version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before geocoding, address data from the EFAP dataset was prepared by separating street addresses into house number and street name components and standardizing borough values. These cleaned fields were required inputs for the Geoclient address endpoint. Once prepared, each address was sent to the Geoclient API using the house number, street, and borough as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each successful response, a subset of geographic fields was extracted from the returned data. These included latitude and longitude for spatial reference, as well as the NTA identifier, which serves as the primary neighborhood key for analysis. While Geoclient also provides additional metadata such as NTA names and census identifiers, only the NTA code was retained at this stage. NTA names are joined later from a reference table to avoid redundancy and maintain clean relational structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all addresses successfully returned an NTA due to nonstandard address formats, basement descriptions, or ambiguous locations. These cases were expected and documented. Rather than dropping these rows from the dataset entirely, they were preserved in the raw EFAP data, and a geocoded analysis-ready subset was created containing only records with valid NTA identifiers and coordinates. This approach maintains data integrity while ensuring neighborhood-level analysis is performed only on reliable geographic assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "After geocoding, validation checks were performed to assess completeness and accuracy. Missing values for NTA, latitude, and longitude were quantified, and spot checks were conducted to confirm that returned NTAs aligned with known neighborhood locations. The resulting EFAP dataset now includes reliable neighborhood identifiers and geographic coordinates and is considered complete for downstream aggregation, schema creation, and integration with NTA-level prioritization data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, no further cleaning or enrichment is required for the EFAP dataset. It is ready to be used in the project’s data model and can be safely loaded during schema creation and analysis."

    "For each EFAP site address, the NYC Geoclient API response was inspected and parsed. When a match was successful, the response returned a nested address object containing geographic metadata. From this object, latitude, longitude, and the neighborhood tabulation area identifier (nta, used as nta_id) were extracted. While additional neighborhood fields such as nta2020 were available in some responses, only the nta_id was retained for downstream analysis, as it serves as a stable neighborhood identifier and can be joined to reference tables to retrieve names or other attributes when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of 561 total EFAP records, 393 addresses were successfully geocoded, meaning they returned valid latitude, longitude, and NTA identifiers. The remaining 168 records resulted in null values for these fields. These nulls were not treated as errors, but rather as expected outcomes due to real-world address quality issues. Common causes included non-standard address formatting (such as cross-street references or basement-level descriptions), missing or ambiguous house numbers, address ranges, or location descriptions that do not correspond to a single parcel. Because the Geoclient API is intentionally strict, no attempt was made to force or infer matches for these records.\n",
    "\n",
    "All records, including those with missing geocodes, were preserved in the dataset to maintain transparency and avoid introducing bias through selective record removal. A missingness audit confirmed that approximately 29.9% of records lacked geocoded values, which is consistent with expectations for administrative and community-reported datasets. These records can either be excluded from neighborhood-level spatial analysis or revisited in future work with additional address cleaning if higher geographic coverage is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the conclusion of this process, the EFAP dataset contained the geographic identifiers needed for neighborhood-level analysis and was considered ready for export as a clean CSV. The dataset is now compatible with downstream steps such as schema creation, database ingestion, and joins with NTA-level tabulation or demographic datasets."
